# React-Edit-User-Pref
This is to reactify the ability to edit particular user preferences in WF

# The dashboard in question:
[Here](https://xandercanedo.my.workfront.com/dashboard/view?ID=5fa0943103c33dbda24582c6aabd7c9a)

## To Do:
-Perhaps I use a JSON viewer to render the data to the user (much like the JSON extensions one has on browser): (package here)[https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-json-view]
-Demo (here)[https://mac-s-g.github.io/react-json-view/demo/dist/]
-Easily collapsable
-Still need to solve for how the user selects the ID to remove/blank out
